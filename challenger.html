    <h1>Space Shuttle Challenger</h1>
    <p>The Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed 73 seconds after lift-off on
      STS-51-L at an altitude of 15 kilometers (49,000 ft). The investigation
      found that cold weather conditions caused an O-ring seal to fail,
      allowing hot gases from the shuttle solid rocket booster (SRB) to
      impinge on the external propellant tank and booster strut. The strut and
       aft end of the tank failed, allowing the top of the SRB to rotate into
       the top of the tank. Challenger was thrown sideways into the Mach 1.8
       windstream and broke up with the loss of all seven crew members. NASA
       investigators determined they may have survived the spacecraft
       disintegration, possibly unconscious from hypoxia; some tried to
       activate their emergency oxygen. Any survivors of the breakup were
       killed, however, when the largely intact cockpit hit the water at
       320 km/h (200 mph), about 32 km (20 miles) east of Cape Canaveral at
       28.64 degrees north, 80.28 degrees west. About half of the
       vehicle's remains were never recovered, and fragments still washed
       ashore as long as a decade later, on the coast of Brevard County,
       Florida.</p>

               Discovery on STS-51-C. He died in the destruction of the Space
               Shuttle Challenger, on which he was serving as Mission Specialist

                during the STS-51-L mission, when it broke up 73 seconds into
                the flight, and at an altitude of 48,000 feet (14.6 km),
                killing all 7 crew members. Smith's voice was the last one heard
                on the Challenger voice recorder. He was a Master of Science
                who held a degree in Aeronautical Engineering.</p>
