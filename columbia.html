    <h1>Space Shuttle Columbia</h1>
    <p>The Space Shuttle Columbia was lost as it returned from a two-week
      mission, STS-107. Damage to the shuttle's thermal protection system
      (TPS) led to structural failure of the shuttle's left wing and the
      spacecraft ultimately broke apart during reentry at an altitude of
      under 65 km. Investigation revealed damage to the reinforced
      carbon-carbon leading edge wing panel resulted from the impact of a
      piece of foam insulation that broke away from the external tank during
      the launch.</p>
    <p>The vehicle broke up over the southwestern United States and fell in
      fragments over eastern Texas and central Louisiana.</p>

              USAF) was an American astronaut and fighter pilot. He traveled into
               space twice: as Pilot of STS-96 and Commander of STS-107. He and
               the rest of the crew of STS-107 were killed when Columbia
               disintegrated during reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.
               Husband is a recipient of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.</p>

               the pilot of Space Shuttle Columbia mission STS-107. He and the

              United States Navy captain and a NASA astronaut. He died on his
              first spaceflight, when the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-107)
              disintegrated during orbital reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.
              Brown became an astronaut in 1996, but had not served on a space
              mission prior to the Columbia disaster. Brown was posthumously
              awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.</p>

               space. She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as
                a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator. In 2003,
                Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space
                Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during
                 its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Chawla was posthumously
                 awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and several
                 streets, universities, and institutions have been named in her
                  honor. She is regarded as a national hero in India.</p>

               pilot and later the first and thus far only Israeli astronaut.
               Ramon was a space shuttle payload specialist of STS-107, the fatal
                mission of Columbia, in which he and six other crew members were
                 killed in the re-entry accident. At 48, he was the oldest member
                 of the crew. Ramon is the only foreign recipient of the United
                 States Congressional Space Medal of Honor, which he was awarded
                 posthumously.</p>
