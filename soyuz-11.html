    <h1>Soyuz 11</h1>
    <p>The crew of Soyuz 11 were killed after undocking from space station
      Salyut 1 after a three-week stay. A cabin vent valve construction defect
      caused it to open at service module separation. The recovery team found
      the crew dead. These three are (as of 2020) the only human fatalities in
      space (above 100 kilometers (330,000 ft)).
     </p>
     <p>The Soyuz 11 landing coordinates are 47.35663°N 70.12142°E, 90
       kilometers (56 mi) southwest of Karazhal, Karagandy, Kazakhstan, and
       about 550 kilometers (340 mi) northeast of Baikonur, in open flat
       country far from any populated area. In a small circular fenced area
       at the site is a memorial monument in the form of a three-sided
       metallic column. Near the top of the column on each side is the
       engraved image of the face of a crew member set into a stylized
       triangle.</p>

                 was a Soviet cosmonaut who commanded the three-man crew of the
                 Soyuz 11 spacecraft. They became the world's first space station
                 crew aboard Salyut 1, but died of asphyxiation because of an
                 accidentally opened valve. They were the first and, as of 2020,
                  the only humans to have died in space.</p>

                 Soviet cosmonaut who flew on the Soyuz 11 mission and was part
                  of the second space crew to die during a space flight. On board
                   the space station Salyut 1 he operated the Orion 1 Space
                   Observatory (see Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories),
                   he became the first man to operate a telescope outside the
                   Earth's atmosphere.</p>
